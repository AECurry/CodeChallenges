//  🏔️ MTECH Code Challenge SD14: "Measuring Water"
//  Concept: Many coding interviews ask candidates to solve some kind of puzzle on their feet as a way to test their ability to reason through a problem. This challenge is designed to practice your ability to think on your feet and reason out loud, instead of in code.

//  Instructions:
    //  You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible. In order to get the most out of this challenge do not use the internet.

//  Notes:
    //  You have 10 minutes to consider this challenge; you may use the space below to take notes on your reasoning or do math, but be prepared to explain your thinking out loud.
    //  You will share with a partner and then the class.

//  ⌺ Black Diamond Challenge:
    //  If there is extra time after sharing, you may then convert this challenge into Swift code below. Do not do so until you've had a chance to reason through it out loud.

// MARK: Student response
/* I would fill up my three-quart jug and pour that into the five quart jug. Then I would fill up my three-quart jug again and fill up the rest of the five-quart jug leaving my only one quart left in the three-quart jug. Then I would completely dump out the five-quart jug and once empty I would pour the 1-quart that was left in my three-quart jug into the five-quart jug and then fill up my three-quart jug again and pour all of that into my five quart jug giving me exactly 4-quarts.
